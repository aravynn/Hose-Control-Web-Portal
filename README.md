Hose Control Web Portal	
-- 

Summary : This simple web portal is designed to allow users to log in and view 
their completed hose tests, which generates PDF documents that can be viewed, 
saved, or printed. These PDFs are simple documents that are generated on command
in the case of changes that need to be done in the case of missing or changed 
information, incorrectly entered information, or other edits. 

The project uses FPDF for pdf generation and a custom built user interface with 
MySQL database storage.
